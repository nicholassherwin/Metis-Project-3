# Metis-Project-3

Create a classification system that models the level of entropy (entropic disposition) in the brain. For simplicity, we will use the simple categories of low, medium and high entropy. We will utilize Robin Carhart-Harris’ model of the entropic brain to find indicators of high and low entropy and attempt to find markers along this scale through both survey question data as well as social media / online markers. (the latter will dip into NLP and project 4).

The overarching idea of this project is essentially the antithesis of the Youtube algorithm. Youtube funnels the user down a path of more and more ‘extreme’ content based on your watch history. A user who watches a video that might have some right-wing tendency (or comments) for example might then be given a video with slightly more right-leaning views and so on. The end result is that the user is entrenched in content from a hyper specific viewpoint. 

For this project, we would like to establish a baseline categorical classification for any given user and expose them to divergent patterns of thinking through a customized narrative delivery. Said another way, we’d like to open up the user to previously unexplored patterns of thinking, to broaden their viewpoint and ultimately help them to break out of established patterns of thought.

We will be populating the categories of low to high entropy with mental markers (depression to low entropy, AHDH to high entropy etc.) and utilizing existing datasets that test for these markers as the training data. There existings a number of studies that map psychological profile tests, social media data etc. to mental illness markers like those above and will be utilizing those tests as our training data.

While there exists many psychological and behavioral tests to determine things like depression, addiction or narcissism, we will be using machine learning in the form of online profile metadata to stand in for such tests. In other words, rather than give individuals a test that ranks them on the entropic scale, we’ll be using machine learning to classify users based on their online metadata. (social media sites etc.)
